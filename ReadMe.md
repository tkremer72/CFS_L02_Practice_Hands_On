Lesson 2 Practice Hands-On
For this Practice Hands-On, you will be creating a page to input your name information, along with a button and an image of yourself. This Hands-On will not be graded, but you are encouraged you to complete it. The best way to become a great programmer is to practice! Once you have submitted your project, you will be able to access the solution on the next page.

Requirements
In the index.html file, add the following:
